| Use Case                  | Producer            | Consumer                 |
| ------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Email processing system   | Webhooks/forms      | Email sender service     |
| Logging engine            | Application threads | Log writer thread        |
| Video encoding pipeline   | Camera frames       | Encoder                  |
| Payment processing system | Checkout flow       | Payment gateway executor |
| IoT data ingestion        | Device telemetry    | Analytics processor      |


Real-Time Use Case	Purpose of Queue
Background job system	Tasks processed in FIFO order
Live chat support	Users handled in queue order
Event processing (clicks, logs)	Buffer for fast producers
Notification system	Hold unsent messages
Producer-consumer threads	Decouple work generation and execution
Order handling	Keep orders in the right sequence
Vehicle/traffic simulation	Simulate real-world waiting behavior


BLOCKING QUEUE:

| Real System                         | Description                                              |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Logging system                      | Multiple threads produce logs, one thread writes to file |
| Messaging system (e.g., Kafka-like) | Producers push messages, consumers pull them             |
| Order processing                    | Orders are added to queue and processed asynchronously   |
| Email/sms sender                    | Queue outgoing messages to senders                       |
| Web scraping                        | URLs pushed into queue, scraped by worker threads        |
| Image processing pipeline           | Cameras push frames, consumers process them              |


ABSTRACT QUEUE

| Scenario                  | Custom Queue Behavior Needed         |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Job scheduling system     | Task priority, retries, time windows |
| Customer support queue    | VIP customers served earlier         |
| Ad delivery system        | Highest bid shown first              |
| Inventory reorder queue   | Time-sensitive stock actions         |
| Emergency response system | Critical cases dispatched first      |
